# WunderGraph Next.js Starter

This example demonstrates how to use WunderGraph with Next.js. We are going to make your data-source accessible through JSON-RPC to your Next.js app.

## Getting Started

2. Install the xsxsxsxs
dewddwe
```dewdeewdewdewedwedew
npm install && npm 
```qdqwd

After a while, a new brodewdwedfwefwfwser tab will open,dqwdqwd
and you can start exploring the application.
If no tab is open, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Running WunderGraph will automatically introspect thdewdewe data-source and generate an API for you.
You can add more Operations (e.g. Queridascasces or Mutations) by adding more "\*.graphql" files to the directory `./wundergraph/operations`.
Each file becomes an Operation. The Operatiodewdewn name is not relevant, the file name is.
